## Lion status

* Good news: The latest TotalFinder starts on Lion (OSX 10.7)
* Bad news: The latest TotalFinder still has some quirks (it will take some time to fix all broken stuff)

This is work in progress. I'm committed to bring all TotalFinder features to Lion.<br/>Also I will continue support Snow Leopard in the foreseeable future.

### Broken TotalFinder features in Lion ([as of 1.1.12](/beta-changes))

* path bar behaves oddly (you need to re-create whole window/tab)
* no tab tooltips (with full path)
* no sidebar mirroring in dual mode
* no sidebar width synchronization between tabs
* horizontal window enlargement when resizing column in Column View
* switching tabs confuses resizing logic (also switching tabs flashes finder background)
* showing/hiding statusbar, toolbar and sidebar may not redraw window (you need to resize it or switch tabs to see the effect)
