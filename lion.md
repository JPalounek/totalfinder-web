## Lion status

* Good news: The latest TotalFinder starts on Lion (OSX 10.7)
* Bad news: The latest TotalFinder does not work in full on Lion (it takes me some time to fix all broken stuff)

This is work in progress. I'm committed to bring all TotalFinder features to Lion. Also I will continue support Snow Leopard in the foreseeable future.

Version 1.1.9 is the first one which runs on Lion. It _works on my machine_<sup>(tm)</sup>:

  * CutAndPaste
  * SystemFiles
  * ColumnViewAutoWidth
  * CopyPathMenu
  * NoDesktopDots
  * Asepsis
* <strike>preferences pane</strike>

* <strike>resizing just using bottom right corner</strike>
* no tab tooltips (with full path)
* no sidebar mirroring in dual mode
* no sidebar width synchronization between tabs
* <strike>drag and drop folder from list view does not work</strike>

* showing/hiding statusbar, toolbar and sidebar may not redraw window (you need to resize it or switch tabs to see the effect)
