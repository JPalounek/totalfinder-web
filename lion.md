## Lion status

* Good news: The latest pre-release of TotalFinder fully works under Lion (OSX 10.7)

I'm committed to bring all TotalFinder features to Lion.<br/>Also I will continue support Snow Leopard in the foreseeable future.

### TotalFinder quirks under Lion ([as of 1.2](/beta-changes))

* horizontal window enlargement when resizing column in Column View
* switching tabs confuses resizing logic (also switching tabs flashes finder background)
* showing/hiding statusbar, toolbar and sidebar may not redraw window (you need to resize it or switch tabs to see the effect)
