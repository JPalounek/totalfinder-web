## Features

#### Motto: <strike>Let's teach Finder new tricks!</strike> No, make Finder rock!

It is finally possible under Snow Leopard with <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a>.

### The goals of this project:

* Make Finder available system-wide on a hot-key (like [Visor](http://visor.binaryage.com))
* Stop creating .DS_Store litter (and make the world a better place)
* Show the folders always on top (and make me happy)
* Add a better keyboard shortcuts (for keyboard-oriented freaks like me)
* Add a dual panel mode (like in good old Norton Commander)
* Enable a cooperation mode with Terminal.app (for command-line lovers)
* Add user friendly [MacFUSE](http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/) support
* And what about better git/svn/mercurial integration?
* [And more satisfaction!](http://getsatisfaction.com/binaryage/products/binaryage_totalfinder)

## FAQ

#### When we can expect first version?
> Working on it. Releasing alpha versions for early adopters on <a href="http://blog.binaryage.com">the blog</a>. It has still rough edges. I need you to help me test it. Thank you!

#### Are you going to sell this?
> Yes. I already gave pretty much <a href="http://binaryage.com">quality stuff</a> away for free. And this is too cool to be seen on everyone's desktops, right? I've spent endless nights on this. So tell your girlfriend to buy you one so you don't have to disassemble Finder on your own. And in the meantime pray I don't get hired by Apple.

#### Should I stay tuned?
> Definitely!
