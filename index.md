## Features

#### Let's teach Finder new tricks!

It is finally possible under Snow Leopard with <a href="http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php">SIMBL</a>.

Goals of this project:

* Solve that .DS_Store problem
* Add dual panel mode (like Norton Commander)
* Make Finder available system-wide on hot-key (like <a href="http://visor.binaryage.com">Visor for OSX</a>)
* And more!

## FAQ

#### When do you release first version?
