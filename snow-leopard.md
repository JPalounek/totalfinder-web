Since Mountain Lion release I have dropped support for Snow Leopard. I understand this may disappoint you, but please let me focus on future. Historical TotalFinder versions work just fine with Snow Leopard, they just lack the latest features and bug fixes.

## The last Snow Leopard compatible version is [TotalFinder 1.3.4](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/changes#1.3.4).

I simply decided to support only last two OS versions. Currently Mountain Lion and Lion.

I wrote about my decision in [this blog post](http://blog.binaryage.com/totalfinder-runs-with-mountain-lions).
