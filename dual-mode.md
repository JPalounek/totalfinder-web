## What is Dual Mode?

Dual mode is a special mode when TotalFinder displays two Finder windows side-by-side. It is a similar view as seen in classic dual-panel file managers. This is handy in situations when you want to move files from one panel to the other easily.

Please note that individual Finder windows still behave the same as if they were individual windows. For example both windows keep their own toolbar. The only difference is that TotalFinder places sidebar of the right-side window to the right edge and syncs its width with left sidebar.

You may enter dual mode by double-clicking a tab or pressing ⌘U. Selected tab will join with the tab next to it and form dual tab with two file browsers side-by-side. To leave dual mode double-click dual tab again. The advantage of this setup is that you may create multiple dual tabs and manipulate them the same way as single tabs.

## What can I do with dual mode?

1. You may **enter dual mode** and create dual tab.
2. You may **leave dual mode** and break dual tab back into two single tabs.
3. You may **switch active panel** when in dual mode.
