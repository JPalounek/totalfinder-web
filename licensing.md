## Trial Version

<div class="license-desk">
You may install TotalFinder and use it in trial mode for 14 days. Then you should decide to buy it or uninstall it.
</div>

Trial version displays `TotalFinder - unregistered version` badge on top of every window.

And it pops a notification dialog after every 10 tabs switches.

This should allow you to evaluate TotalFinder functionality and decide whether you want to buy it or not.

## Free licenses

## Office license

You may also want to check [office license page](/office-license) for info on licensing to groups like companies, offices or labs.

## Buying a license

<img src="/images/licensing-icon.png" style="width: 32px; float: left; margin-right: 10px">

Please visit [the store](https://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/instant/totalfinder) where you can purchase TotalFinder for $15. It is safe and easy (powered by [FastSpring](http://fastspring.com)).

## TotalFinder updates

When you buy a license you may freely update to all TotalFinder versions within one major OS release. For example by buying TotalFinder today you will get free updates for all Snow Leopard compatible versions.

A new major OS release will probably require substantial rewrites and intensive testing. I will charge existing users an upgrade fee for a new OS. I expect it to be 50% of the full price.

## The license agreement

When you buy a TotalFinder license you get my permission to use the software. Usual conventions apply, here is [the legal code](/license.txt).

<div class="license-desk">
<p>You may use your license in either of two ways:</p>
<div class="choice">1. <strong>one user on multiple computers</strong> <span class="note">(as long as you are the only user using TotalFinder)</span></div>
<div class="example">Example: a desktop computer and a personal laptop which are both used exclusively by you</div>
<div class="choice">2. <strong>multiple users on a single computer</strong></div>
<div class="example">Example: a home computer which is shared by all family members</div>
</div>

## TotalFinder and your privacy

TotalFinder does not connect or communicate over the network. It works perfectly on a computer disconnected from the internet.

There are two cases in which TotalFinder optionally sends data over the network:

* Sparkle updating system - when checking and downloading a new version
* Crash reporting dialog - when you explicitly click "Send Report..." button

## TotalFinder reliability

I have tested TotalFinder with my system and I did my best to make it bug-free and stable. However it may still contain undiscovered bugs or issues.

<div class="license-warning">
Also please note that I'm not in control of what Apple does with Finder in the future. Although unlikely, it may happen that some future update makes it impossible for me to adapt TotalFinder or some of its functionality to a new Finder version. By buying the license you accept this risk.
</div>

<div class="license-exclamation">
You are using TotalFinder at your own risk. I'm not responsible for anything bad which could possibly happen using this software.
