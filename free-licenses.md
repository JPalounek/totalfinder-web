## Free licenses

I will grant a free license to everyone who meets any of these criteria:

1. created or significantly contributed to open-source project or tool I used in TotalFinder
2. is on my free give-away licenses list for helping me with TotalFinder (e.g. [translators](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors))
3. is one of the winners of the crash reporting lottery
4. is using valid `<someone>@google.com` email address (as "thank you" for the Chromium project and great meals [at GDD](http://www.google.com/events/developerday))
5. who feels that he/she should get a free license for some other reason and makes me agree
