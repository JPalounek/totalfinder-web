## Free licenses for users

I will grant a free license to everyone who meets any of these criteria:

1. created or significantly contributed to an open-source project or tool I used in TotalFinder
2. is on my free give-away licenses list for helping me with TotalFinder (e.g. [translators](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors) or [visit this page](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n) if you want to help with translation)
3. is one of the [winners of the crash reporting lottery](http://blog.binaryage.com/winners-crash-reports-lottery/)
4. is a Google engineer and using a valid `someone@google.com` email address - this is my "thanks" for the Chrome project and great meals [at GDD](http://www.google.com/events/developerday)<br>
   note: slow down, this does not apply to `@gmail.com` and `@googlemail.com` users
5. is an Apple employee and using a valid `someone@apple.com` email address - this is my general "thank you" for making awesome products
6. feels that he/she should get a free license for some other reason and makes me agree

Please [drop me an email](mailto:antonin@binaryage.com) and I will issue a free license for you if you meet the criteria.

## Free licenses for the press

Journalists and bloggers may apply for a TotalFinder license if they plan to review it.
