## Free licenses for users

I will grant a free license to everyone who meets any of these criteria:

1. created or significantly contributed to open-source project or tool I used in TotalFinder
2. is on my free give-away licenses list for helping me with TotalFinder (e.g. [translators](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n/contributors) or [visit this page](http://github.com/binaryage/totalfinder-i18n) if you want to help with translation)
3. is one of the [winners of the crash reporting lottery](http://blog.binaryage.com/winners-crash-reports-lottery/)
4. is a Google engineer and using valid `someone@google.com` email address - this is my "thanks" for the Chromium Project and great meals [at GDD](http://www.google.com/events/developerday)<br>
   note: slow down, this does not apply to `@gmail.com` and `@googlemail.com` users
5. who feels that he/she should get a free license for some other reason and makes me agree

Please [drop me an email](mailto:antonin@binaryage.com) and I will issue a free license for you if you meet the criteria.
