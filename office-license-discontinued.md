## Licensing for companies, labs and working groups

TotalFinder is an app for end users with a dead simple licensing scheme. You buy a single personal license for your machine. <span style="font-size:10px">Or alternatively you buy a discounted multi-license pack to be installed on multiple computers you own.</span>

<b>The problem with companies is that over the time people are hired and fired. And computers are always being added or removed, some are fired too. Nobody wants to keep track of head counts and care about licenses. You have more important things to do.</b>

## Office licensing is the solution

Let's say you are Smart Boss of Cool Company, just happen to be holding a credit card and have some people from 2nd floor desperately asking you to buy TotalFinder for the whole group. What would you do?

1. You may of course buy a plain multi-license and keep track of the head count and do it the classic way.
2. **Or you may be smart by buying a multi-license and additional $50 TotalFinder Lock which enables you to forget about the whole problem**.

## What is the TotalFinder Lock?

The TotalFinder Lock is a separate license which costs $50 and allows you to cover future fluctuations in the group for one year.

The day you buy it:

1. you must apply it immediately to some well-defined group ("Cool Company's Mac users on 2nd floor")
2. you must have real licenses covering the actual number of members, but at least 3

## Sounds good, where can I buy one?

Glad you like it. Here is the [instant TotalFinder Lock purchase page](https://sites.fastspring.com/binaryage/instant/totalfinderlock).

The name of the group should be part of the lock order where you **enter it into "Company" field**.

After purchase you may put the TotalFinder license key(s) on group's wiki, send it to group's mailing list or do whatever fits the group. It would be nice if you don't leak it to the internets right away. Thanks!

## What happens after one year?

The lock just expires and you lose its protection. Don't worry - your existing licenses are still valid.

Because I know exactly when you've purchased the lock I've instructed my robot to send you a reminder email 14-days before expiration. You will have 14 days to evaluate the current situation, do some math and decide whether to either buy a new lock or just simply stop locking and use your multi-licenses the classic way.

## What if the group gets released?

The lock expires. This is a risk of buying a lock for group. You should buy it for long-term groups. Short-term groups should just use classic multi-licenses which is more flexible for this case anyway.

## Does it work for any company size?

Yes, a company is a proper group, I don't care about the size. But bigger is always better.

## Is it backwards compatible?

Yes, I'm a programmer. The lock can be used with unused licenses you already own (including unused licenses which you have from expired locks). Just keep in mind that each license can be used just with one active lock at a time. Make sense?

## Give me some examples

* **Small WebDev studio** = whole company, 6 people, 1 owner, all using Macs => (6+1)*$10 + $50 = $120
* **MegaCorp** = 42nd department, cubicles in sector H12, 30 people, 1 boss, 12 using Macs => 12*$10 + $50 = $170
* **University Lab** = lab#4, 30 Mac machines, 2 admins with various machines including Macs => 32*$10 + $50 = $370

This is math which can be done easily in your head.
